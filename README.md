# Currency calculator in JavaScript.

Simple addition of numbers and output of the result in monetary units using the `Intl.NumberFormat` constructor.
 - fill in all(!) fields with numbers;
 - `Calculate` button or
change the `UAH/USD` option.
The rate value is defined in the `currency` object - it is assumed that this value will come from the server.
